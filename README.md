# clipdaemon

A simple GTK+ based daemon for clipboard persistence.

Forked from [ClipIt](https://github.com/CristianHenzel/ClipIt).

# Installation

Clone the repository and run -
```
cd clipdaemon
make install clean
```
Make sure that `$HOME/.local/bin` is in the PATH environment variable, as it is
the default installation destination ([Makefile](./Makefile)).
